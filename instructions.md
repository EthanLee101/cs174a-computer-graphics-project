# Final Project Instructions

Each team is expected to implement interactive graphics and/or mouse picking + min 2
"advanced" features, as described below and discussed with your TA

• Most stories are inspired by existing games, extend to 3D
• You can use 3js (modeling objects, bump maps, particles, etc.) and OBJ loaders, but no other external libraries or frameworks are allowed; see examples folder for ideas, e.g., for placing 2D/3D texts in your scene


## What counts as advanced features:

• Ray tracing  
• Shadowing
• Collision detection
• Physics-based simulation
• Bump mapping/displacement mapping
• Artificial intelligence
• Scientific data or simulation visualization


## Code
• Ensure code is runnable/executable without compilation errors
